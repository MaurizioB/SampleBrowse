Welcome to the setup procedure for SampleBrowse.

This one of the earliest releases, SampleBrowse is in beta stage and might not work at all.

If you find some bugs or think that SampleBrowse behaves in a "wrong" way, please visit the GitHub project page at https://github.com/MaurizioB/SampleBrowse (a shortcut to it will be available in the Start menu, if created).
